# Templating

@@View@@ is a decorator which can be used on a controller method (endpoint).
This decorator will use the response returned by the method and will use the view to create the output.

::: warning
@@View@@ is available since v5.63.0. For older version use @@Render@@.

::: tip 
The configuration engine is exactly the same as Express configuration engine.

## Usage

A template engine like [EJS](https://ejs.co/) or [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) can be used to change the response returned by your endpoint.
Like Express.js, you need to configure the templating engine so that you can use it later with the @@View@@ decorator.

Here is an example of a controller using the @@View@@ decorator:

<<< @/docs/docs/snippets/controllers/response-templating.ts

And its view:
```html
<h1><%- name %></h1>
<div>
    Start: <%- startDate %>
</div>
```
